# Deep Text Eval (DTE)

## Problem
A differentiable function that measures text complexity/readability will be beneficial as part of the loss function of neural network text simplification system. However, to our best knowledge, there are not such a differentiable
function.

## Basic Idea
Train an RNN to measure the ext complexity/readability. RNN is differentiable by
its nature. This RNN will be part of a future building block for the loss of a
neural network text simplification system.

## Learning Task
TBD
